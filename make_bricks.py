Make Bricks challenge in Python 3.4
Required code: 
      def makeBricks(small, big, goal):
Goal: Determine if you can reach the exact goal amount only using the pieces given.
Note: small = 1 unit. big = 5 units.
Example:
  >> makeBricks(3, 1, 8) == True (Because 3*1 + 1*5 == 8)
  >> makeBricks(3, 1, 9) == False
  >> makeBricks(2, 3, 9) == False
Solve with as few characters as possible.
Characters used in solution: 40
